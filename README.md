# 10 Object-Oriented Programming: Team Profile Generator

## User Story

```md
AS A manager
I WANT to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
SO THAT I have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles
```
### Summary 
The idea of this app was to be able to generate profiles for your team members using the Inquirer module from the Node command line. This information gathered from the user would then be automatically put into an HTML document, and have functioning links to the team members email and GitHub links.
